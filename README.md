# Asteroid Dataset Classification
- This repo consist the code as well as the report on the experiment.
- The experiment is about classifying asteroids based on the classes, using selveral Machine Learning algorithms (in this case; Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost).
- The report consist of the results, comparison, and inferences based on the performences of these models.
